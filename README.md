This project develops a dual snake game in Python, utilizing two distinct pathfinding algorithms, A* and Breadth-First Search (BFS), to control two snakes within a shared 50x50 game grid. The primary aim is to compare the performance and efficiency of the two algorithms under identical game conditions. Each snake, represented by different colors (red for A* and blue for BFS), navigates the grid independently, trying to consume apples while avoiding dynamically generated obstacles. The game environment for each snake is visually overlaid yet operates independently, ensuring identical conditions for a fair comparison. The snakes' movements and interactions with the game environment are managed using Pygame, a popular Python library for writing video games.
